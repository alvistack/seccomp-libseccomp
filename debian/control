Package: libseccomp2
Architecture: linux-any
Description: Evnhanced Seccomp (mode 2) helper library
 The libseccomp library provides an interface to the Linux Kernel's
 syscall filtering mechanism, seccomp. The libseccomp API abstracts away
 the underlying BPF-based syscall filter language and presents a more
 conventional function-call based filtering interface.
